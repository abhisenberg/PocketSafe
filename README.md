### Details
This very simple UI has this trigger button, which-
1. Starts a timer which waits for you to put your phone in your bag/pocket
2. When the phone is inside, the proximity sensor is started
3. Now as soon as the phone is taken out of the pocket, this action is sensed by the phone
4. And an alarm in MAXIMUM VOLUME is started, which can only be stopped when the owner unlocks the device through password.
